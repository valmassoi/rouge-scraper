# Rouge scraper
Web scraper that checks Rogue Fitness stock of 35-55lb plates every minute. Their `Notify Me` button is probably delayed, so this should help get to the front of the line for new inventory. Either check console output or wait for an in stock notification (MacOS).

## Install
`npm i`

## Usage
edit `./items.consts.js` `url`s and `wantedItems` to match the exact product names  
`npm run start`

## Test
`npm run test`
